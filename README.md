# Engineering 4 Notebook
These are my Engineering 4 assignments to learn to use the Raspberry Pi
## Hello Raspberry Pi

### Reflection
This assignment to me a little while to get started on, because I had to replace my first Pi, which wouldn't even turn on.  However, after I did that, Beagle Term (on a chromebook) proved easy to use, and I learned how to create a new directory ("mkdir") and how to make my first Raspberry Pi program with Beagle Term, by editing the .py file in "nano" and then using "python3" to run it.

### Reflection
I was able to connect to my phone's hotspot easily, but I had some major trouble when working in Beagle Term.  I figured out that after I reach the end of a line, it continues to type at the beginning of the same line. This led to me attempting to rename my repository, and then I ran into issues with duplicate directories, and directories within other directories that couldn't be deleted easily. Eventually, I was able to completely delete my old repo and the cooresponding directory and start over (after learning a lot of Linux commands). After this, the rest went fairly smoothly, although I noticed that the "git push origin master" command has been changed to "git push origin main."
